    "<p> Shaders are programs that calculate the values of <b>pixels</b> of an image in order to create depth, lighting, and other effects. This is very similar to shading techniques in physical art media.</p>\n",
    "<p> 3D shapes are 'rasterized' into a 2D image of pixels to realize them on a screen. The shader then manipulates each pixel to approximate the effects.</p>\n",

    "Shaders perform similar instructions on thousands of pixels many times per second. Since the instructions are similar, they are performed through <b>parallel processing.</b> As computer graphics became more advanced, it made sense to develop a separate processing unit to execute these instructions so that the CPU could be unburdened. Performant GPUs are necessary to play the latest games and to perform heavy video editing and rendering.\n",

    "# Ray Tracing\n",
    "A relatively recent turn in computer graphics, <b>ray tracing</b> is a different process of rendering images compared to rasterization. Rasterization creates the illusion of depth by approximating shadows and scaling. <p>Ray tracing instead tracks beams of light from a point of view and calculates how they would bounce off of and interact with objects in a scene. This creates a much more realistic and detailed image, with the cost of being extremely computationally expensive. </p>\n",
